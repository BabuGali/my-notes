- **Symmetric Encryption**
	- A Single Key, Shared Key
	- Encrypt with the key
	- Decrypt with the same key
- Doesn't scale very well
	- can be challenging to distribute
- Very fast to use
	- less overhead than than the asymmetric encryption
- **Asymmetric Encryption**
	- Private Key
		- Keep this private key
	- Public key
		- anyone can see this key
      - The private key is the only key to decrypt the data encrypted using the public key
      - you cant derive the private key from public key
      - Key Generation
	      - Build both public and private key at the same time
	      - Lots of randomization
	      - Large prime numbers
	      - Lots of Lots of Math
