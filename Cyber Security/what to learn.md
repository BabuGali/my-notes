Before learning technical skills, you need to identify the subdomain of your interest. Here are few subdomains within cyber security:

- **Application Security**
- Network Security
- **Cloud Security**
- **Malware Analysis**
- **Incident Response**
- **VAPT** (Vulnerability and Penetration Testing)
- SOC(Security Operation Center)
- **Compliance and Risk Management**

Note: This is not an exhaustive list.

Skills you need to get a job will vary from domain to domain. However, there are some common topics which you should be familiar with regardless of the subdomain you want to work in. Here is the list:

- Internet Basics

- Servers

- DNS/DHCP

- Internet Protocols
- HTML Basics

- Programming/Scripting (Note: Cybersecurity folks usually don’t put much effort in learning programming but the reality is that if you want to work for top companies like Google then you need to have a very good knowledge of programming, DSA and System Design - your career growth can be accelerate by programming skills)

- Python/C/C++ or any other language of your choice
- Bash Scripting

- Applied Cryptography

- Symmetric Cryptography
- Asymmetric Cryptography

- Basic cybersecurity terminologies: Attacks, Risks, Confidentiality, Authenticity, Non-repudiation, Availability, Risk Management, Attack vectors, OWASP Top 10, Penetration testing,
- Security compliance and Governance

Now, let’s dive deeper into what exactly you will do as a cybersecurity professional in some of the subdomains:

- Application Security: You need to make applications more secure by identifying gaps in them. For example, Instagram is one of the applications. Application security is the process of developing, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security vulnerabilities against threats such as unauthorized access and modification. Some of key skills of application security engineers are:

- Secure Coding
- OWASP Top 10 attacks and mitigation strategies
- Applied Cryptography
- Programming or Software Development
- Threat Modeling
- Designing secure architectures

- Network Security: It encompasses any activity which protects integrity and usability of the network. As a network security engineer you need to develop a mechanism which prevents threats from entering or spreading into your network. You may have heard about firewalls which are one of the tools to prevent threats. Here networks can be wireless(Wi-Fi) or wired(Ethernet). Some of the key skills of network security engineers are:

- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- Network Protocols like OSPF
- Authentication and Authorization
- Applied Cryptography
- Basics of Application Security

- Cloud Security Engineer: You need to make your cloud infrastructure more secure. For example, if you’re working in Google then making GCP secure is very important because many organizations will be hosting their data into your cloud. Any breach can have major repercussions.Some of the key skills of cloud security engineers are:

- Cloud Overview
- Virtualization
- Compute/Storage/Resource Hardening
- Logging/Tagging
- Identity and Access Management
- Cloud Incident Response/Compliance
- Cloud Architecture
- Applied Cryptography
- Computer Networks
