- SSID Broadcast
	- SSID - Service Set Identifier
	- The SSID is the name of a wireless network that is broadcasted so devices can easily discover it.
	- By default, most wireless routers broadcast the SSID, making the network name visible to nearby devices.
- Best security measures
	- WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
	- WPA2 encryption
	- Setting a strong, complex password.
	- Implementing MAC address filtering, if necessary.
- Best Practices:
	- Disabling SSID broadcast should be used as part of a layered defense strategy.
	- Ensure proper encryption and regularly update the router's firmware for better overall security.
