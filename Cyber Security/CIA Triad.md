CIA Triad is the combination three principles
	- Confidentiality
		- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems  
		- certain information should only be known to certain people
		- Encryption -Encoded message only certain people can read
		- Access Control - selectively restrict access to the resource
		- Two-factor authentication
	- Integrity
		- Data or message can't be modified without detection
		- Any data modification to the data would be identified
		- Hashing
		- Digital signature
		- Certificates - combine with digital signature
		- Proof of integrity
			- **Verify data does not change** - The data remains accurate and consistent
			- In cryptography, we use a hash 
			- If the data changes, the hash changes
	- Availability
		- Systems and Networks must be up and running
		- Always at your finger prints
		- Redundancy
		- Fault Tolerance
		-
