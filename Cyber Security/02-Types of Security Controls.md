There are several types of controls to protect software, hardware, network and data
	- Physical Controls
		- data centre perimeter fencing
		- locks
		- guards
		- access cards
		- biometric access control system
		- Surveillance Cameras
		- intrusion detection sensors
	- Digital Security Control or Technical Security 
		- usernames and passwords
		-  two-factor authentication
		- antivirus software and firewalls
		- ID's
	- Cybersecurity Control
		- anything specifically designed to prevent attacks on data, including DDoS mitigation and intrusion prevention systems
	- Cloud Security Control
		- include measures that you take in cooperation with a cloud services provider to offer the necessary protection for data and workloads
	 - Managerial security controls or administrative Security Controls
	- operational security controls
		- Patch management
		- Configuration management
		- System backups
- Other Types of Security Control
	- Detective Control
		- Identify incidents after they've occurred so that corrective action can be taken.
	- Corrective Control
		- Reduce the effect of an incident.
	 - Preventive Control
	 - Deterrent Control
	- Compensating Control
		- Alternative controls used when a primary control isn't feasible.

- Security Control Frameworks
		- National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework
		- Center for Internet Security controls
	-A well-developed framework helps make sure that an organization:
		-  Enforces IT security policies through security controls
		- Educates employees and users about security guidelines
		- Meets industry and compliance regulations
		- Achieves operational efficiency across security controls
		- Continually assesses risks and addresses them through security controls
- Security controls assessments
	-  A security controls assessment enables you to evaluate your current controls to determine they are implemented correctly, operating as intended and meeting your security requirements.
		- Some key steps for creating a security assessment
			- Determine the target systems
			- Determine the target applications
			- Conducting vulnerability scanning and reporting
- Deterrent Control  and Preventive Control
	- Deterrent Control
		- Discourage people from performing an action by making them fear the consequences. For example, a "Beware of Dog" sign or large fines for speeding are deterrent controls. Deterrent controls are often the first line of defense and can be especially effective against inexperienced attackers.
	- Preventive controls
		- Prevent an incident from occurring or reduce its impact. For example, a locked warehouse with access restricted to authorized employees is a preventative control. Preventive controls can protect a system, but they don't eliminate the risk of an incident.
		- Configuration management
